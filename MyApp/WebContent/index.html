      The National Road Safety Partnership Program (NRSPP) Total Road Incident
      Cost Calculator was designed to provide organisations with an estimate of
      the direct and indirect costs associated with a road incident. The
      calculator presents an estimate of total incident costs in simple terms,
      underlining how much each incident could potentially cost an organisation
      in terms of lost revenue or service provision. In so doing, it helps
      organisations understand the cost of road incidents relative to
      productivity, profitability and service delivery. The calculator will help
      you articulate the additional production or service delivery needed to
      recover the Total Cost of Risk.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Who Can Use The Calculator?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      recognises the differences in operations and business structure across
      different sectors. To this end, tailored solutions and calculations are
      provided for the Manufacturing and Services sector, State and Local
      Government sector, Health and Emergency Services and Other Community
      Services and Not-for-Profit organisations.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>The Calculator has three main parts</h3>
    <br />
    <h3>1. Input</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The input section is where the user enters information on the
      organisation, e.g. the type of sector, the main product manufactured or
      main service delivered, number of road incidents a year, insurance
      details, fleet size, annual mileage where applicable include any ‘grey
      fleet’ exposure.<br />

      What is sometimes confused by organisations is even a ‘grey’ fleet will
      contribute to additional hidden, uninsured costs should it be involved in
      a traffic incident. Please refer to Appendix A for templates to assist in
      compiling the necessary data from a variety of sources in your
      organisation.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Calculate</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      This information is then used to calculate the direct and indirect costs
      as well as other key statistics. This can be used as the first step to
      using the online calculator.<br />

      From a privacy point of view, the information provided in this section is
      not stored, instead, only the sector and output information are stored for
      use in future industry benchmarking.<br />

      The calculations include a number of key indicators about the frequency of
      incidents involving your fleet, such as the overall claim rate which
      indicates the number of incidents per 100 000 kilometres travelled, the
      number of kilometres travelled before an incident occurs and the overall
      claim rate per vehicle. These can be used for future industry
      benchmarking, and assist with performance monitoring and setting future
      targets that indicate risk improvement.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Output</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The calculator then presents the overall financial findings which
      indicates the severity of incidents. This includes a breakdown of the
      total direct costs for the managed fleet (i.e. annual premiums and excess
      paid), total indirect costs for the managed fleet (using a conservative
      estimate of three times the damage bill covered by insurer) and the
      overall costs which include any grey fleet exposure. These costs are then
      related to the organisation’s revenue and a typical, indicative product in
      the results section.<br />

      What this is designed to show your senior executives is just how many
      products need to be manufactured, or services provided, to cover the
      additional costs of your fleet risk, over and above what your Insurer
      provides.
